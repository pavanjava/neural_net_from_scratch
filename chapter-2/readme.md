## Chapter 2
#### Agenda

- Single Neuron using numpy
- layer of Neurons using numpy
- using numpy to code batch of inouts to a neuron

### numpy way of multiplying vector-vector, vector-matrix, matrix-matrix

- the common command that is used is `np.dot(a,b)`
- where a,b are one of the above said categories.

- Note: always remember np.dot(vector, matrix) != np.dot(matrix, vector)
- Note: always remember np.dot(matrix1, matrix2) != np.dot(matrix1, matrix2)
